# About
<pre>
The project, that our team has selected is <b>JavaScript - Personal Finance Tracker.</b>
It has been made using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
The site consists of different sections and pages that are interrelated.
For making this website, GitHub Copilot has proven to be a great asset for us.
We have also used different Microsoft technologies for completing this project.

<b>Goals and objectives</b>

<li>A user-friendly interface where the user can track his daily/monthly income or expenditures.</li>
<li>The active balance sheet that the user can edit anytime.</li>
<li>A to-do list where person can add his desired goals of investments, if any.</li>
<li>The primary goal of this project is to balance the daily expenditures of the person for the better future.</li> 


<b>Stacks we used:</b>

<strong>HTML</strong>
HTML is essential for building the user interface of a project. It allows us to 
define the layout, structure,and visual elements of the application. Using HTML 
we created forms, input fields, buttons, dropdown menus,and other UI components 
needed to collect user input and facilitate interactions.

<strong>CSS</strong>
CSS allows us to style various HTML elements and create visually appealing designs. 
We implemented responsive design techniques to ensure our project looks and functions 
well across different devices and screen sizes. It allows us to customize the project's 
design, create engaging user interfaces, and convey a professional image.

<strong>JavaScript</strong>
JavaScript enables us to capture user input from forms and perform validation before 
submitting data. We dynamically generate and update content on the website. It is used 
to implement filtering functionalities. We represent expense categories through pie charts. 
It provides access to the browser's local storage, which allows us to store data on the user's device.

<b>Use of GitHub Copilot</b>
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI. 
1. Efficient Code Writing:  Copilot analyzes the context and suggests relevant code snippets,
reducing the need for manual typing and saving time. 
2. Boilerplate Generation: Copilot provides us the initial code structures, including basic 
HTML layout, CSS styles, and JavaScript event handling, reducing repetitive manual setup. 
3. Code Refactoring : When working on an existing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript codebase, Copilot 
identify redundant or inefficient code patterns and propose more optimized alternatives. 
4. Developer Productivity: By assisting with code completion and offering intelligent suggestions, 
Copilot enhancesour(developer) productivity. It reduces the cognitive load associated with remembering 
syntax details, and encourages faster code iteration and experimentation.

<b>Division of the time:</b>
Preparing the idea:
Formulate Clear Goals and Constraints.
Brainstorm Ideas and Select the Most Feasible Ones.
Conduct Research and Gather Information.
Create Prototypes and Mockups.
Refine and Validate Ideas through Feedback and Iteration. 
Assign Roles and Responsibilities.

<b>Implementation:</b>
Break Down the Idea into Tasks and Milestones
Set Realistic Deadlines and Prioritize Activities
Agile Methodologies for Iterative Development
Foster Effective Communication and Collaboration within Teams
Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Conduct Frequent Testing and User Feedback Sessions. Iterate and Refine the Solution based on Feedback
Track Progress and Adapt as Needed
